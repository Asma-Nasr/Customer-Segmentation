# Customer Segmentation
Task 5 @Elevvo ML Internship

## Instructions
1. Dataset (Recommended): Mall Customer ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)).
2. Cluster customers into segments based on income and spending score.
3. Perform scaling and visual exploration of groupings.
4. Apply K-Means clustering and determine optimal number of clusters.
5. Visualize clusters using 2D plots.

### Bonus:
1. Try different clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN).
2. Analyze average spending per cluster.
